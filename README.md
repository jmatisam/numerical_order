Java Number Sorting Project

Project Context and Objective
The ability to sort data is an essential skill in programming. For this reason, our development team has set out to design and create a Java program that allows users to sort a list of manually entered numbers. This project aims to provide valuable practice in handling data and implementing basic sorting algorithms such as bubble, selection and insertion algorithms.

Project description
The project will consist of an interactive program in which users will be able to:

Enter a list of numbers: The user can enter a list of numbers that they want to sort.
Select Sorting Algorithm: Several sorting algorithm options will be offered for the user to choose which one to use.
Display the ordered list: Once the algorithm is selected, the program will sort the numbers and show the ordered list to the user.

Sorting Algorithms
The project will implement the following basic sorting algorithms( i will choise one)I:

1-Bubble Sort:

Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Repeat the process until no more exchanges are needed.

2-Selection Sort:

Finds the minimum element in an unordered list and places it at the beginning.
Repeat the process with the remaining items.

3-Insertion Sort:

Build the list ordered element by element.
Inserts each new element into the correct position within the already sorted list.
Program Structure
User interface:

Number Entry: A section where the user can enter the numbers they want to order.
Algorithm Selection: Options to choose the desired sorting algorithm.
Results Display: Show the sorted list once the algorithm has finished sorting the numbers.
Sorting Logic:

Algorithm Implementation: Implementation of the aforementioned sorting algorithms.
Data Management: Methods for receiving and processing the list of numbers.
General Steps of the Program
Prompt the user to enter the list of numbers.
Ask the user to select the sorting algorithm they want to use.
Apply the selected algorithm to sort the list.
Show the ordered list to the user.
